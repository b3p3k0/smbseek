    - CVE-2020-1472
  name: ZeroLogon
  aliases:
    - Netlogon privilege elevation
  severity: critical
  description: >-
    Netlogon authentication bypass allowing attackers to take over Windows Domain Controllers.
    Detected via SMB because DCs expose NETLOGON/SYSVOL shares alongside the vulnerable service.
heuristic:
  required_signals: 2
  base_weight: 30
  risk_band: high
  conditions:
    - signal: has_netlogon_share
      expectation: true
      rationale: NETLOGON share exposure is a strong domain controller indicator.
    - signal: has_sysvol_share
      expectation: true
      rationale: SYSVOL share visibility further confirms domain controller role.
    - signal: ipc_share_accessible
      expectation: true
      rationale: Attack requires access to IPC$/Netlogon channels for the RPC abuse.
  boosters:
    - description: Anonymous or guest access to IPC$ drastically lowers exploitation barriers.
      weight: 10
    - description: Public network exposure (e.g., via Shodan) increases the likelihood of targeting.
      weight: 5

notes:
